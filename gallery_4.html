        <h1>Boglárka  &  Lori</h1>
        <h2>
          It happened at least 20 years ago when Aunt Juliska ran after the tractor in the neighboring street because the young man, who was around 5 or 6 years old at the time, though not visible from the seat, waved goodbye as he slowly drove away from the street with the loud UTB 650. Aunt Juliska was the grandmother, and Lóri was the fiancé. Everyone admired how she loved being among machines, and even back then, it was evident that she was the kind of person who wouldn't shy away from work.
        </br></br>
Meanwhile, not far apart in space and time, Boglárka was born, with her blonde curls, and suddenly, several photos from children's camps come to mind, where we can see her as a little girl, smiling. Although they couldn't have known it at the time, one day the two separate stories would converge, and suddenly it became apparent that the respectful and modest Lóri started courting Boglárka, who seemed to smile even more beautifully since then.
</br></br>
After the big decision, the planning of the wedding came, and they entrusted us with capturing the memories, which was an honor for us. Since then, their little baby has been born, and they live happily... a true success story.
</br></br>
We wish you happy years, joyful family moments, perseverance in what you do, and enthusiasm every day, just like the enthusiasm with which the red tractor once started its engine.
