        <h1>A n d r e a  &  B o t o n d</h1>
        <h2>When wedding inquiries come in, we find it important to meet the new couple in person and feel that "spark" that helps us take on the task of capturing their big day. It requires a basic sympathy and the feeling that: Yes, they are the ones whose wedding we should photograph. In these cases, they will also understand and appreciate what we do. Andrea and Botond knew our work from the internet, and when we met, we knew it would work because we saw two very simple, modest, likable people in them.

        </br></br>

          Andrea illuminated the moments of the wedding and the day of creative photography with her infinite kindness. The way she spoke to her husband, the way she touched him, looked at him... it all spoke of genuine joy. This radiance is a privileged state in the days after the wedding, and it's great to see couples where it doesn't fade away.
          Botond, with his features reminiscent of an American actor, truly opened up the opportunity to create something beautiful together in the photos... he could be imagined on a magazine cover, but it's worth so much more that he is now primarily Andrea's happy husband.
