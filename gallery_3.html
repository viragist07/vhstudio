        <h1>Bogl치rka  &  Levente</h1>
        <h2>
          A few years ago, we met Bogl치rka as a bridesmaid, and even then, it was apparent how she reacted to certain situations with a big smile. You might think that there is no person in the world to whom a smile comes so naturally... Bogl치rka proved that it's possible to live like this, to react like this, even when life is not easy and not a piece of cake.
          A smile perhaps reaches its true destination when there is a response to it... and this is where Levente comes into the picture, who, as a groom, responded to these smiles just as naturally as his wife. The story had a third protagonist as well, the couple's little daughter, who bravely endured the creative photo shoot, even though hundreds of mosquitoes were smiling at us up close, and it was quite challenging for us to reciprocate.
        </br></br>
          Bogl치rka, Levente, thank you for placing full trust in us and allowing us to capture the most beautiful moments from this event so that you can relive them with joy when you look back. We rejoice with you and wish you many happy moments together!
