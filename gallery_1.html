        <h1>K r i s z t a  &  L e v i</h1>
        <h2>I could write so much about them... but I just smile. I loved every moment of it, the way they experienced it, and how our little team of photographers and videographers experienced it. I knew Kriszta would be a special bride... but when I entered the room and saw her... I had such a wow feeling... I knew she would be beautiful, but to this extent... Kriszta had that beauty, purity, and love that every photographer wants to capture at a wedding. The truth is, working as an artist requires much greater effort and challenge... not to mention photographing a bride who has been photographed by many as a model... so there was an extra factor that equaled a few morning coffees on the wedding day. The groom... When I think of Levi, I smile in the same way... maybe because he always smiles... his face is burned into my retina. With his calmness and love for his family, he made the whole situation uplifting. He saw what was important to Kriszta and danced the dance that made her happy... we quickly became friends with him too, and we became richer with his presence... I wish every woman had such a husband, and then the world would be happier! Little Beni was also an important part of the day... I loved how he made the atmosphere unique in the church, it was sweet that he was always in the right place. ðŸ™‚ Of course, we could mention the parents, grandparents, the host, the guests, the musicians, the decorations, or the restaurant... everything was so beautifully put together at this wedding, nothing stood out... it shows Kriszta and Levi's creativity and attention to detail.
