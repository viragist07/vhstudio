        <h1>K i n g a  &  H e n g i</h1>
        <h2>
            We were high school students when towards the end of class we heard the sound of a door slamming in the hallway. Usually, loud laughter followed, and then three young men emerged through the door: Hengi, Lóri, and Csabika. During the break, we would laugh together. Many years have passed since then, and the request came: Hengi is getting married, and they wanted us to photograph the event. Hengi's wedding was a true nostalgia party for me. The door didn't slam this time, but something hadn't changed: Csabika and Lóri were there, along with many others because Hengi was always someone who was loved by many. We could continue our conversation where we left off 10 years ago because he remained the same Hengi.
            </br></br>
            I only knew Kinga by sight, but when they came to discuss the details with us, joy welled up inside me: yes, Kinga is the person meant for Hengi. The ease and honesty that I saw in Kinga immediately gave me the feeling that everything would be just fine here.
            </br></br>
            Kinga had some qualities as a bride that were anything but average: no stress, everything was fine, no need to worry about the details, this day could be approached with naturalness.
            </br></br>
            The photos can speak the most about the wedding day. It can't be denied that there was a true Pittyes atmosphere here, and the Pittyes trio greatly contributed to it. Although they tried to disappear among the guests with infinite modesty, they occasionally made an appearance to the delight of the wedding party, which then ended with great laughter.
            </br></br>
            Kinga and Hengi's request was that things should not follow the usual scheme at the reception... and it worked out. The first joint "dressing up" was already a blast, and we were left astounded because you could feel in the air that something really good was unfolding.
            </br></br>
            On the day of the creative photoshoot, the weather forecast showed 80% chance of rain on all of our phones. We told each other this, and nevertheless, we set off for the photo shoot. When we arrived, it was already pouring rain. There wasn't a single umbrella in the three cars, and even the dog got wet in the first 10 minutes. It would sound very romantic if I were to say that eventually the weather became beautiful, the rain stopped, etc. But that's not what happened.
            </br></br>
            It rained throughout. We changed the location and took photos in an unconventional way.
            </br></br>
            Kinga, Hengi, it was an experience with all of you. We couldn't have started the wedding season better. You were really cool, and let this short compilation speak for it now.
            </br></br>
            We wish you good health, and may this ease remain with you even on the difficult days! Finally, as Hengi would say:
            </br></br>
            Thanks, hey!
