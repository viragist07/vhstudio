My project was to create a visually stunning and user-friendly website for a wedding photography company. The primary objective was to showcase the company's exceptional photography skills and expertise in capturing beautiful moments on a couple's special day. The website needed to convey the company's unique style, professionalism, and dedication to creating timeless memories for their clients. With a focus on elegance and visual appeal, the website design aimed to create an immersive experience that would leave a lasting impression on visitors. By carefully selecting high-quality images and utilizing modern design elements, I strived to create a captivating online presence for the wedding photography company, reflecting their commitment to excellence in every aspect of their work.

It is divided into four main sections:

Home: The homepage features a captivating carousel slideshow that sets the tone for the company's expertise and photography style. The website is optimized for both mobile and desktop devices. When accessed from mobile devices, the menu collapses into a hamburger-style menu. Flexbox techniques were used to achieve a flexible element structure. As a result, the website is highly responsive and smoothly adapts to different screen sizes.

About Us: This section introduces the team behind the company, providing information about the three team members and highlighting their experience, passion, and dedication to the profession.

Portfolio: The portfolio section is the centerpiece of the website, showcasing an extensive collection of the company's wedding photographs. It consists of ten different photo galleries, each displaying a unique collection of images. The galleries are dynamically created using JavaScript, ensuring easy updates and additions in the future. Visitors can navigate through the galleries to get an idea of the company's artistic vision and photography skills.

Contact: The contact form allows visitors to get in touch with the company. It provides a convenient way for potential clients to request information about services, inquire about pricing details, or schedule consultations.

The website was developed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML5 provides the structure and content of the site, CSS is used for styling and visual enhancements, and JavaScript is utilized for dynamic functionalities such as creating photo galleries and managing form submissions. In addition, I implemented a web-request technique by i-framing third-party web galleries. This approach allowed for seamless integration of external galleries into the website, expanding the range of showcased wedding photography and providing visitors with a diverse and comprehensive portfolio. The responsive design of the website ensures that the integrated galleries maintain their visual appeal and functionality across different screen sizes and orientations, offering an optimal browsing experience for all visitors.
