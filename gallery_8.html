        <h2>
            
            It was a special feeling to be part of Helga and Norbi's important day and creative photoshoot... Perhaps because Helga's past years of life were not indifferent to us. From the little girl she was until she grew up, many events connected us, and not just events, but friendship and a trusting relationship.
          
            I always knew she was a very strong girl, and I also knew that her honesty would eventually yield results, and despite all the difficult times, the sun would shine.
         
            I think such sunshine entered her life when Norbi came into the picture. Because Norbi is exactly the kind of person Helga deserved, and I saw that from the first photoshoot...
          </br></br>
            When the day of the creative photoshoot came, I went to photograph them a bit apprehensively. I knew Helga was a perfectionist, and her standards were set high. But I also knew that if she liked the result, it would mean recognition for us as well.
          
            Somehow, the lights, the dress, the love between them, the memories, everything came together in one place, and we managed to capture photos that pleased them.
          
            Norbi, we are genuinely happy for you and grateful that Helga entrusted her life to such a gentleman! Helga, thank you for your honesty and your always encouraging approach!
          </br></br>
            May you be blessed and happy in your married life!
